      "body": "\"In addition to any amplification, the opportunity for the rate and opportunity of unauthenticated reflection seems problematic.  One possible thing to consider would be to stipulate that debugging should only be returned for an already existing connection by default, as opposed to sending it to any more easily-spoofed packet (e.g., initial SYN).  This would at least minimize the risk by forcing an attacker to be able to spoof the connection details.  I think this is what the document implies, but I'm not sure it is clear.\n\nAnother thing that might reduce the risk is to stipulate rate limits like routers do for ICMP messages. See 4.3.2.8 Rate Limiting in IETF RFC 1812 for example.\n\"",
